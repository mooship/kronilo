# Kronilo

Kronilo is a small, fast web app for translating and understanding cron expressions. Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, it helps developers and operators read, validate, and preview cron schedules in seconds.

If Kronilo saves you time, consider buying the project a coffee to help maintenance and translations:

## üà≥ Adding a New Translation

To add support for a new language, follow these steps:

1. **Add your translation file:**
   - Create a new folder for your language code in `public/locales/` (e.g., `public/locales/ja/` for Japanese).
   - Add a `translation.json` file with your translations.

2. **Centralize your language settings:**
   - Edit [`src/locales.ts`](src/locales.ts) and add your language code, display name, and (optionally) cronstrue locale mapping. **Please keep this list sorted alphabetically by display name.** This file is used by i18n, the language switcher, and cron translation logic.

3. **Update cronstrue locales (if supported):**
   - If your language is supported by [cronstrue](https://github.com/bradymholt/cronstrue), add a declaration to [`src/cronstrue-locales.d.ts`](src/cronstrue-locales.d.ts).
   - Add a static import for your cronstrue locale (e.g., `import "cronstrue/locales/xx";`) to [`src/components/CronTranslation.tsx`](src/components/CronTranslation.tsx). This ensures translations work correctly for your language.

4. **Test your translation:**
   - Run the app locally and switch to your new language using the language switcher.
   - Check that cron translations and UI strings appear correctly.

5. **Open a pull request:**
   - Submit your changes for review. Include your translation file and all code updates.

**Note:** If your language is not supported by cronstrue, the cron expression translation will fall back to English, but UI strings will still be localized.
